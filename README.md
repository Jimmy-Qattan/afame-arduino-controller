# afame-arduino-controller

This is a special project where you have an A-frame project and you have an arudino set-up where you have a proximity sensor for positioning of the A-frame camera, the thumbstick/joystick to control the rotation of the A-frame camera, and the 8x8 LED Matrix where it will tell you your position relative to the 8x8 meter ground in A-frame.

Made using Web Serial Api, Aframe, THREE.js, and Arduino.
